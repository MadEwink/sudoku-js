## About the project

I love playing sudoku, and playing a bit on my computer made me want to develop my own game interface, in order to learn a bit more about javascript. I also like the challenge of thinking an intuitive interface.

I also want the game to be adaptative, so that people can implement new rules, such as chess moves restraints.
